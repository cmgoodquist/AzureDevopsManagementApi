# AzdosManagementDashboard API
This code exposes a facade over the Azure DevOps REST API, extending Azure DevOps with an abstracted project configuration layer. Whether you're working across multiple projects, or simply iterating on your preferred project configuration over time, it's convenient to push standardized updates to your organization(s) at the click of a button.

# Getting Started
This .NET Core app includes Swagger UI. Once deployed, to view the API surface, navigate to the Swagger endpoint at ```<BASE_URL>/swagger```. For example:
